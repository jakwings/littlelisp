Thanks to: https://github.com/maryrosecook/littlelisp

It a custom simple call-by-value LISP interpreter implemented in Javascript.
It has keywords like "define"(not macro), "let" and "if", and basic types
"function", "double", "string", "boolean"(implicit). It also supports currying
without particular specification of function definitions. No supporting for
syntax checking nor error throwing. ;-)
